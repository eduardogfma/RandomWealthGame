# Random Wealth Game
The present project came from a simple question: 

> What would happen if a set of agents with a fixed amount of coins played a game in which they had to randomly choose another player to give money to?

That is it! No more rules.

Code is written in python3, making use of standard libraries.

## Update:

 1. Constraining agents, not allowing them to have debt is now available.
